<h1 align="center">🔒 Welcome to the Physical Security Repository 🔒</h1> <h3 align="center">Your comprehensive guide to understanding, implementing, and mastering physical security in the context of cybersecurity.</h3>
<h2 align="left">🛡️ Why Physical Security is Critical to Cybersecurity</h2> <p align="left"> In the world of cybersecurity, digital threats often take the spotlight, but it's vital not to overlook the role of physical security. Physical security involves safeguarding tangible assets—servers, data centers, workstations, and more—from unauthorized access, damage, or interference. Weak physical security measures can leave an organisation's cybersecurity efforts vulnerable to compromise. </p> <p align="left"> Even the most advanced firewalls or encryption systems can be bypassed if an attacker can gain physical access to hardware or sensitive areas. Devices can be stolen, tampered with, or compromised, leading to severe breaches. For this reason, a solid cybersecurity strategy begins with strong physical security. </p> <p align="left"> This repository is your one-stop resource to learn why physical security is a foundational layer in cybersecurity and how to implement it effectively to protect your critical assets from both digital and physical threats. </p>
